# Poltype Installation Guide

To get started you will need to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#) (Linux Distribution) to your home directory on ARC

(The anaconda on ARC from module load is out of date and your own local install of Anaconda allows for more flexibility, however the module load conda can still work) 

- To dowload it to your working directory use `wget "link"` using the link to the anaconda install 

- Use `chmod +x` to make the install script executable, run the install script

- Towards the end of the install it may prompt you to initialize anaconda for your bash shell: `conda init bash`
  This will modify your bashrc script to allow ARC to activate your base conda environment on start up of a new terminal. If you opt out of this step you will need to specify the absolute path to anaconda in the future

- For now activate your conda environment with `source activate` (or if that does not work `conda activate`) and you should see your base environment is activated


Once Conda is running change directories to: `/projects/welbornlab/Poltype2/master/Environments`

Now we will create our Poltype environment with the provided .yml file 

`conda env create -f environment-psi417.yml`

This will take a little while as the dependencies are downloading. Check the environment list to see if successful

`conda env list`

You can also check by activating the environment through `source activate poltype_psi417` (make sure to switch back to your base environment through `source deactivate` for the next step) 

Create a new environment and activate that environment to install the necessary software

`conda create --name xtbenv`

`conda activate xtbenv`

`conda install -c conda-forge xtb -y`

The path to this conda env will need to be used later, see the [usage guide](./Poltype_Usage.md)

# INTRODUCTION

This workflow below will go through the process of preparing a Polymer system for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the Tinker MD engine. This is a general overview and can be adapted to fit your needs and specific systems. A beta-glucose dimer will be used as an example throughout this tutorial. There will always be multiple ways to accomplish some steps and these will be mentioned when possible!

## Workflow:

All steps are optional, and will depend of the system you're working on and the files already available to you.

1. Parameterize the monomers with Poltype2 to be used for Tinker MD simulation with AMOEBA Force Field. [parameterization-for-amoeba.md](./parameterization-for-amoeba.md)
2. Create the polymer input structure. [create-polymer-with-pymol.md](./create-polymer-with-pymol.md)
3. Solvate the polymer and add ions. [solvate-polymer.md](./solvate-polymer.md)
4. Basics of running Tinker MD. [running-tinker-basics.md](./running-tinker-basics.md)
5. Trajectory analysis and helpful tools. (Under Development)

Steps to follow to parameterize a polymer.

Here we will parameterize a Beta-Glucose Dimer. The molecule looks like this:
![bgdimer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2cfb451-6813-42a1-8ef6-5f6e8d051ecf)

We will first make the molecule using PyMOL builder. You can download PyMOL [here]([https://pymol.org/](https://pymol.org/)), and get an academic license if you need it.
